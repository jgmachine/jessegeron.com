**This is a placeholder file.**

This section will include AI resources, policy frameworks, and guides specifically for K-12 education. Expect things like:

- AI policy templates and best practices
- Guidance on effective AI use for students, teachers, and staff
- Curated resources and tools for educational technology leaders
- Thoughts on AI integration in schools
- Conference takeaways and industry trends

Since AI is rapidly evolving, this will likely be one of the more frequently updated sections as I work through developing policies and frameworks for the districts I support.
