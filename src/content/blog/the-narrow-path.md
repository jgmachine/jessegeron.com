I've spent the last few days spiraling down a rabbit hole. It was the good kind, the kind that makes you sit up a little straighter and realize that the work we do in schools isn't just about curriculum delivery anymore. It is about the trajectory of human civilization.

I recently came across two videos by Tristan Harris, the co-founder of the Center for Humane Technology. You might recognize him from The Social Dilemma. Watching him speak is like watching someone describe a car crash in slow motion. The only difference is that he has been describing the crash since 2013, and most of us are just now noticing the glass shattering.

## The Architect of Awareness

Back in 2013, Tristan was a Design Ethicist at Google, sounding the alarm on how social media was engineered to hijack our attention. He saw today's problems, like polarization and the mental health crisis, long before they were headlines.

Some might call him an alarmist, but to me, he feels like a realist. He isn't just fear-mongering. He is advocating for a collective "pulling together." He believes that if we can see the problem clearly, we can change the outcome.

As a Millennial, I'll admit I feel like our generation has drawn the short straw more than once. We lived through the "First Contact" of social media, and now we are the ones expected to lead through the AI revolution. It is easy to feel a sense of nihilism about it all. However, being a nihilist doesn't help my kids, and it doesn't help the students sitting in our classrooms right now. Their ability to live a good life is worth the effort of a "humanity-first" approach.

## The Narrow Path: Chaos vs. Dystopia

If you have an hour this week, I highly recommend watching these two resources in order:

**[The "First Contact" Discussion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4ZY25OU4Ys)**: Tristan breaks down how we have already had our first encounter with AI through the social media algorithms that curated our feeds and inadvertently broke our shared reality.

**[The TED Talk: Why AI is Our Ultimate Test](https://www.ted.com/talks/tristan_harris_why_ai_is_our_ultimate_test_and_greatest_invitation)**: This is where he introduces the concept of The Narrow Path.

Tristan visualizes our future as a choice between two extremes. On one side is Chaos, where unregulated, decentralized AI leads to a total collapse of trust through deepfakes and social fracturing. On the other side is Dystopia, where highly regulated AI is kept solely in the hands of massive corporations or authoritarian governments.

The Narrow Path is the thin sliver in the middle. This is where we use technology to enhance human wisdom rather than replace it.

## The Power We're Surrendering

One insight from Tristan's discussion particularly struck me: the historical power dynamic between people and institutions has always been rooted in labor. When workers were essential to production, they had leverage. Strikes worked. Collective action mattered. People could demand change because governments and corporations needed them to keep the system running.

But what happens when the workforce itself becomes optional?

Tristan draws a fascinating parallel between traditional immigration and what he calls "digital immigration." We've built entire regulatory frameworks around physical immigration—quotas, visa systems, border policies—precisely because we recognized that large-scale labor displacement could destabilize society. We understood that an influx of workers competing for jobs required careful management and protection for existing workers.

Yet when it comes to AI—these digital immigrants capable of replacing cognitive labor at unprecedented scale—we're taking the opposite approach. We're not just allowing them in, we're racing to deploy them as fast as possible with minimal oversight or consideration for the displacement they'll cause. The irony is stark: we regulate human immigration to protect jobs, but we're all-in on welcoming artificial workers that could fundamentally shift the balance of power away from people entirely.

If we lose our leverage as the essential workforce, what power do citizens retain to hold institutions accountable? It's a question that should be central to every conversation about AI deployment, yet it's rarely discussed in those terms.

## Why This Matters for TK-12 Education

This isn't just a tech conversation. It is a classroom conversation. In our schools, we are already seeing the ripples. We worry about students losing the ability to think critically or write original works. We are entering an era where students might not be able to trust their eyes or ears due to deepfakes. Furthermore, the mental health struggles and the need for companionship in this age group are real concerns that AI will only complicate.

**But here is the silver lining:** Our students are keen. They are skeptical. They know the world is changing, and they are waiting for us to show them how to navigate it.

## What We're Doing About It

Next week, I am sitting down for our district's first AI Committee meeting. We aren't just talking about which apps to buy. We are establishing AI Guidelines that prioritize responsible use.

Our goal isn't to ban the technology. That is a losing battle. Our goal is to teach students to use AI to elevate their work, not replace their thinking. We need to equip them to be informed citizens who understand the stakes. If we don't teach them to navigate the Narrow Path, who will?

I am keeping Tristan Harris on my radar, and I hope you will too. We have a choice in how this story ends. Let's make sure we are choosing the path that leads to a future worth living in.
