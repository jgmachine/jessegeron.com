Welcome! I'm Jesse Geron, a K-12 technology leader working in educational technology, AI policy development, and systems integration. This site is mostly a place for me to collect my thoughts and organize resources in a way that's easy to share. You can learn more about me and my background [here](/about).

## Why This Site Exists

This experiment was really sparked by attending the [FETC](https://www.fetc.org/) conference in Orlando, FL this past week. Coming back with so many ideas, resources, and insights, I found myself trying to figure out how I could organize all of my thoughts in a way that would actually be useful - both for myself and for the educators and districts I work with.

I've never been very successful in keeping up a "blog" or personal website in the past, but with this specific goal in mind, I'm hopeful this may be a valuable place for me to collect my thoughts. No promises on consistency, but the intention is genuine.

## Building This Site

This site itself is an example of how AI tools have made personal projects more accessible. I spun this up with the help of Claude - starting with [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code) until I ran out of requests, then pivoting to VS Code using GitHub Copilot's Agent leveraging Claude Sonnet 4.5. Between the two, I was able to design the site, troubleshoot bugs, and get initial content created much faster than I could have on my own.

It's built with Astro and Tailwind CSS, which I chose for their simplicity and performance. The whole process has been a learning experience and a reminder that modern AI tools can help bridge the gap between having an idea and actually bringing it to life.

## What You'll Find Here

This site is a mix of professional and personal interests:

- AI resources and policy frameworks for K-12 education
- PowerShell scripts and automation workflows
- Tech industry thoughts and conference takeaways
- Book reviews (mostly sci-fi and tech leadership)
- Board game musings
- Occasional biking adventures

Think of it as a digital notebook that happens to be public. If it's helpful to you too, that's a bonus.

Thanks for stopping by!
