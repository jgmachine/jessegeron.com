A delightful sci-fi series that takes the concept of Von Neumann probes (self-replicating machines) and runs with it in the best way possible. Bob Johanson, a software engineer, dies and has his consciousness uploaded to become the controlling AI of a space probe designed to explore and replicate itself across the galaxy.

## What Makes It Great

The original trilogy is the strongest part of the series - tight storytelling, great humor, and fascinating exploration of what it means to be human (or post-human). As Bob replicates, each copy develops its own personality, creating a universe of Bobs with different priorities, quirks, and missions.

The series gets more expansive (and a bit more scattered) as it progresses, but the core concept remains compelling throughout.

## The IT Connection

As a software engineer protagonist, Bob approaches problems with an IT mindset that's incredibly relatable if you work in tech. There's something satisfying about watching someone solve galaxy-spanning problems by essentially being a really good systems administrator and engineer. The technical thinking and problem-solving feel authentic.

## Why I Love It

I'm a sucker for hard sci-fi that takes a real scientific concept - in this case, Von Neumann probes - and explores the implications thoughtfully. The self-replicating probe concept has been around in theoretical discussions for decades, and Taylor does a fantastic job making it personal and entertaining.

The humor is sharp, the stakes feel real, and watching Bob(s) navigate everything from first contact scenarios to existential threats while maintaining their essential humanity (despite being AI) makes for a genuinely fun read.

## Who Should Read This

- Sci-fi fans who enjoy hard science concepts
- Anyone in IT or software engineering
- Readers who like stories about AI and consciousness
- People who appreciate humor mixed with their space exploration
- Fans of self-aware, nerdy protagonists

## The Series

1. We Are Legion (We Are Bob) - ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
2. For We Are Many - ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
3. All These Worlds - ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
4. Heaven's River (and beyond) - Still good, but more sprawling

The original trilogy is peak Bobiverse. If you love it, the later books are worth continuing, but the first three are where the magic really happens.
