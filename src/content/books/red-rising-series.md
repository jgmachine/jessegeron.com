A fantastic sci-fi series set in a future where humanity is divided into a color-coded caste system, with the Golds ruling over all. Darrow, a Red from the lowest caste, infiltrates the elite Gold academy to bring down the system from within.

## The Story

The series kicks off with that "battle school" trope - young elites training together in brutal competition - but it's executed with such intensity and creativity that it feels fresh. The action scenes are absolutely visceral and intense, keeping you on the edge of your seat.

It's sci-fi with strong dystopian and space opera elements, blending political intrigue with raw action and rebellion.

## Series Structure

The original trilogy is the strongest and most cohesive part of the series. Books 1-3 form a complete, satisfying arc with Darrow's perspective driving the narrative.

Book 4 onwards shifts to include multiple perspectives, which changes the feel somewhat. Still enjoyable, but the original three books are where the series really shines.

## What Makes It Work

- **Intense action** - The combat and battle sequences are incredibly well-written
- **Political intrigue** - As much about strategy and maneuvering as fighting
- **Character development** - Watching Darrow navigate two worlds and evolve
- **World-building** - The color-coded caste system is fascinating and horrifying
- **Stakes that matter** - You genuinely care about the outcome

## Who Should Read This

- Fans of dystopian sci-fi
- Readers who love intense action sequences
- Anyone who enjoyed Ender's Game or The Hunger Games but wants something grittier
- Space opera fans who like their stories character-driven
- People who appreciate political intrigue mixed with action

It's been a while since I read it, but it remains a solid, memorable series. The original trilogy especially is worth your time.
