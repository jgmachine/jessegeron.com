**This is a placeholder file.**

This section will include technical documentation, deployment guides, and how-to articles related to K-12 IT work. Things like:

- Chromebook deployment procedures
- PowerShell scripts and automation workflows
- Systems integration documentation
- IT process improvements and workflows
- Technical guides for common tasks

These will be practical resources that might help other K-12 IT folks dealing with similar challenges.
