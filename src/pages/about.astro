        <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 dark:text-white mb-4">Hi, I'm Jesse 👋</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">
          I'm a K-12 technology leader and developer passionate about making technology work better for schools and students. 
          Currently serving as Senior Programmer of Curriculum and Instruction Integration at Shasta Union High School District, 
          where I focus on AI policy development, systems integration, and helping educators leverage technology effectively.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">
          My path in tech started young - tinkering with a Commodore 64 as a kid, writing those first "if-then" statements, and 
          being fascinated by what computers could do. That early spark never went away. Fast forward through Windows 95, 
          college years with my first Mac, and now I work across both Windows and macOS environments, appreciating what each brings to the table.

        <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 dark:text-white mb-4">What I Do Professionally</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">
          I've been working in K-12 IT since 2013, starting as a Computer Support Technician and working my way up through 
          technical and leadership roles. What I enjoy most is finding efficiencies, improving workflows, and building systems 
          that make everyone's job easier. Whether it's adopting ITIL frameworks, onboarding Fresh Service, or writing PowerShell 
          scripts to automate tedious tasks - I'm always looking for ways to streamline operations.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">
          Shasta Union High School District has a unique setup - we provide IT services to over 30 other local educational agencies 
          (LEAs), mostly school districts but also a couple of county offices of education. This gives me the opportunity to work 
          on solutions at scale and see the impact across multiple communities.
        </p>
        
        <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 dark:text-white mb-3 mt-8">AI Policy & Leadership</h3>
        <p class="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">
          A major focus right now is developing AI policies and frameworks for the districts I work with. There's so much 
          information out there about AI in education - I'm not trying to reinvent the wheel, but rather synthesize best practices 
          and create practical policies around effective AI use for students, teachers, and staff. This website is partly born 
          from that need: a place to organize resources, share thoughts, and document what I'm learning as AI rapidly evolves 
          in education.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">
          The intersection of technology leadership and AI integration is where I see K-12 IT heading, and I'm excited to 
          be growing in this space.
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 dark:text-white mb-3 mt-8">Coding & Automation</h3>
        <p class="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">
          I love writing PowerShell. I wouldn't call myself an advanced developer, but I've built tools that solve real problems - mostly 
          focused on data synchronization between systems and automating workflows. I have a few PowerShell modules published on 
          <a href="https://www.powershellgallery.com/profiles/jessegeron" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-400 hover:underline">PowerShell Gallery</a> 
          and on GitHub (<a href="https://github.com/jgmachine" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-400 hover:underline">personal</a> / 
          <a href="https://github.com/jgeron-suhsd" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-400 hover:underline">professional</a>).
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">
          What's exciting about AI tools now is they've unlocked new possibilities for personal projects that would've taken 
          me significantly longer (or been beyond my current skill level) to build on my own. This site itself is an example 
          of that - combining my technical interests with AI-assisted development.

        <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 dark:text-white mb-4">Education & Credentials</h2>
        <ul class="space-y-2 text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">
          <li><strong>MBA in IT Management</strong> - Western Governors University (WGU)</li>

        <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 dark:text-white mb-4">The Scenic Route</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">
          Before landing in K-12 IT, I took a detour through television and radio production. I started at KNVN in Chico working 
          in Master Control, then moved back home to Redding where I worked at KRCR (the local news station) in various production 
          roles - camera operator, floor manager, audio, editing - eventually directing the morning news show. I loved the creative 
          problem-solving and fast-paced environment of live TV.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">
          But like many small-market media jobs, it didn't pay the bills. When the opportunity came to work in K-12 IT in 2013, 
          I was able to reignite my early passion for technology while also making a sustainable living. Turns out, the 
          problem-solving skills and pressure management from live TV translated pretty well to keeping school technology running smoothly.

        <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 dark:text-white mb-4">Beyond the Keyboard</h2>
        
        <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 dark:text-white mb-3 mt-6">Tabletop Gaming</h3>
        <p class="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">
          My journey into modern tabletop gaming started in 2014 when I randomly picked up Settlers of Catan at Target. I brought 
          it to my bachelor party on a houseboat at Shasta Lake, and we had a blast. When I got back home, I started researching 
          expansions and discovered there was this whole world of modern board games beyond what I grew up with. My collection 
          has been growing ever since.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">
          I got deep into the hobby, but my existing friend group wasn't quite as into it. I tried organizing monthly game nights, 
          but they fizzled out. The problem was simple: all these great games are no fun without people to play them with. So in 2018, 
          I started <a href="https://rage.quest" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-400 hover:underline">RAGE 
          (Redding Area Gaming Enthusiasts)</a> - a public tabletop gaming group to meet new people who shared this passion.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">
          There's something special about stepping away from screens and sitting face-to-face with people around a table, playing 
          with cardboard and dice, sharing a cold beverage, and creating those shared experiences. It's the kind of social connection 
          that's easy to lose when you spend all day working with technology.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">
          We currently meet on the third Friday of every month at Fratelli's Pizza in Redding, CA. Running the group has been an incredibly 
          rewarding experience. I've met amazing people and made genuine friendships through this shared hobby. If you're in the area and love
          board games, come join us!
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 dark:text-white mb-3 mt-6">Mountain Biking</h3>
        <p class="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">
          Redding is a mountain biker's paradise with over 250+ miles of trails, including the incredible Swasey Recreation Area. 
          The surrounding region offers even more - Mount Shasta, Trinity County (including Weaverville) - all within reach for day 
          trips or weekend adventures. It's one of the best-kept secrets for mountain biking in Northern California.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">
          There's a natural overlap between some of the RAGE folks and local mountain biking enthusiasts. A small group of us combines 
          both passions every summer with "Boys Weekend" - an annual trip where we spend our days hitting the trails and our evenings 
          around the table playing games. It's the perfect way to unwind with good friends.
